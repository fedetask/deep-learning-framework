# Deep Learning Framework
My implementation of a tensorflow-like deep learning framework. The goal is to develop
efficient and easy to use code to design and train simple neural networks.

## Computation Graph
The framework works with the concept of computation graph. Operations -such as dot
products, activations, etc- are defined as nodes in the computation graph.
